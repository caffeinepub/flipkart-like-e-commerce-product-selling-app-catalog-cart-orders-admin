# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a “Flowers” product category and multiple flower products to the demo catalog created by the backend demo initialization.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the backend demo initialization flow to create a new category named exactly “Flowers”.
- Add at least three new demo products assigned to the “Flowers” category, each with an English title/description, a non-zero price (in cents), and stock ≥ 0.
- Ensure the new flower products are discoverable through existing storefront behaviors: product list, category filter, and search.

**User-visible outcome:** After an admin runs “Initialize Demo Data,” the Shop page includes a “Flowers” category that filters to flower products, and searching for flower keywords (e.g., “rose”, “bouquet”) returns the new flower items.
