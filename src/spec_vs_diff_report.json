No frontend changes are shown (as required), and project_state.json was updated with pending feature requests.",

      "requirement": "Create multiple (at least 3) flower products under the new \"Flowers\" category during backend.initialize() so they appear in listProducts, search, and category filtering.",
      "reason": "The diff snippet only shows the beginning of adding a \"Flowers\" category (the declaration starts) but does not show any product creation tied to that category. Because the file is truncated, there is no visible evidence of adding >=3 products, ensuring their titles/descriptions/prices/stock, or that search/filter paths will return them.",
